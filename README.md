# DMep

## Description
A simple program coded in C# to en- and decrypt files into .dmef files using a password.
It uses AES for en- and decryption. The filename will stay, but the type (.txt e.g.) will disappear for more security.

## !!Disclaimer!!
Parts of the code were coded with ChatGPT. Be careful using this code, as I can't promise you wont get DMCA striked.
